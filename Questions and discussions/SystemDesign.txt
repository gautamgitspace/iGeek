Layers of a Cloud Computing Stack:
----------------------------------------

• SaaS applications are designed for end-users, delivered over the web
  - Web access to commercial software
  - Central management of software
  - one to many model
• PaaS is the set of tools and services designed to make coding and deploying those applications quick and efficient
  - Services to develop, test, deploy, host and maintain applications in the same integrated development
  - Web based user interface creation tools help to create, modify, test and deploy different UI scenarios
• IaaS is the hardware and software that powers it all – servers, storage, networks, operating systems
 - Resources are distributed as a service
 - Allows for dynamic scaling 

To help understand how these 3 components are related, some have used a transportation analogy;

By itself, infrastructure isn’t useful - it just sits there waiting for someone to make it productive in solving a particular problem.
Imagine the Interstate transportation system in the U.S. Even with all these roads built, they wouldn’t be useful without cars and trucks to
transport people and goods. In this analogy, the roads are the infrastructure and the cars and trucks are the platform that sits on top of the
infrastructure and transports the people and goods. These goods and people might be considered the software and information in the technical realm.

n-tier architecture:
--------------------


If I understand the question, then it seems to me that the questioner is really asking "OK, so 3-tier is well understood,
but it seems that there's a mix of hype, confusion, and uncertainty around what 4-tier, or to generalize, N-tier architectures mean.
So...what's a definition of N-tier that is widely understood and agreed upon?"

The classic 3-tier architecture: database, "business logic" and presentation, is a good way to clarify how to honor the principle of separation of
concerns. Which is to say, if I want to change how "the business" wants to service customers, I should not have to look through the entire system to
figure out how to do this, and in particular, decisions business issues shouldn't be scattered willy-nilly through the code.

Now, this model served well for decades, and it is the classic 'client-server' model. Fast forward to cloud offerings, where web browsers are the user
interface for a broad and physically distributed set of users, and one typically ends up having to add content distribution services, which aren't a part
of the classic 3-tier architecture (and which need to be managed in their own right).

The concept generalizes when it comes to services, micro-services, how data and computation are distributed and so on. Whether or not something
is a 'tier' largely comes down to whether or not the tier provides an interface and deployment model to services that are behind (or beneath) the tier.
So a content distribution network would be a tier, but an authentication service would not be.

3 TIER ARCHITECTURE in WEB SYSTEMS:
------------------------------------
In the web development field, three-tier is often used to refer to websites, commonly electronic commerce websites, which are built using three tiers:

1. A front-end web server serving static content, and potentially some cached dynamic content. In web based application, Front End is the content rendered
by the browser. The content may be static or generated dynamically.
2. A middle dynamic content processing and generation level application server, for example Ruby on Rails, Java EE, ASP.NET, PHP, ColdFusion, Perl,
Python platform.
3. A back-end database or data store, comprising both data sets and the database management system software that manages and provides access to the data.

BENEFITS OF LAYERED ARCHITECTURE:
-----------------------------------
1. Abstraction, easy to implement OO concepts, It makes the logical separation between business layer and presentation layer and database layer,
Migration to new graphical environments is faster, New rules or new validation rules can be defined any time and changes made to middle layer will not
effect presentation layer.

Q - Can DNS use TCP? In which cases DNS uses TCP?
A - DNS uses TCP for Zone Transfer over Port: 53
It is necessary to maintain a consistent DNS database between DNS Servers. This is achieved by the TCP protocol.
This communication happens between DNS Servers only. The Zone Transfer feature of DNS Server will always use TCP protocol.
The connection is established between the DNS Server to transfer the zone data and Source and Destination DNS Servers
will make sure that data is consistent by using TCP ACK bit.

DNS uses UDP for DNS Queries over Port: 53
A client computer will always send a DNS Query using UDP Protocol over Port 53. If a client computer does not get response from a DNS Server,
it must re-transmit the DNS Query using the TCP after 3-5 seconds of interval.

Q - How does BGP work?
A - BGP is an Exterior Gateway Routing Protocol and is used to do routing between ASs or ISPs. Has 4 message types: Open(Open a BGP session with the peer),
Keeplalive(duh!), Update(Routing updates) and Notification(Bad!). Main reason to use BGP is influence inbound or outbound(mostly) routes. This means giving
preference to one path over other depending on various factors and policies. Has a long metric list. N-W-L-Li-AS path-O-M-N-I. Has two flavors. eBGP and iBGP.

Q - What's the difference between a router and switch?
A - Router: L3 device, High forwarding rates, Highly configurable, connects two LANs, WANs, PDU-Packet, each port has own broadcast domain, does forwarding on
software logic (Routing Tables)
Switch: L2 device, less configurable, connects devices in a LAN, PDU-Frame, each port has own collision domain and whole switch is one broadcast domain, does forwarding
on hardware logic (CAM and ASICs)

Q - Define bandwidth
A - bandwidth is technically the data capacity of a network. It measures the volume of data for a transmission connection.
Bandwidth is measured in kilobits per second or “Kbps.”

Q - SDN Architecture
A - The Controller in Control Plane is the brain of the Networking Device. Rather than each device having its own brain, the Controller is a single brain
controlling hundreds of devices.  Benefits - Easier management(policies). The Controller can push centralized  polices and configuration down to the data
plane. An application programmer can create an application that commands the Controller through the REST or JAVA API(North Bound Communication using the
North Bound API). The controller then uses OpenFlow(South Bound API) to update the flow tables in the switches giving them instruction of the flow.(South
Bound Communication). OpenFlow only updates the flow tables. Does not install routing protocols.

3 Layers of SDN Architecture:
1. Application Layer -  Where the Application resides. This application talks to the Controller using the REST or JAVA API
2. Control Layer - The Control Plane where the Controller resides. Receives communication from the application(North) and sends instructions to the
Infrastructure layer via the OpenFlow
3. Infrastructure Layer - The Data Plane. Performs forwarding.

East West Communication - Controller X talks to Controller Y in the Control Layer.

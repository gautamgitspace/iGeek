Interview Questions (Quite Geekish or maybe less) 

# Contains practice problems focused around:
1. [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) - My attempt at nearly all the problems. Written majorly in python.
2. [Career Cup](https://www.careercup.com/) - Began to do it. But lost interest mid-way (Must've found something more intriguing)
3. Bit Manipulation Questions - A good space to spend time with, if you are preparing for Google, Cisco Systems or Juniper Networks.
4. Maps/Hashes/Dicts or whatever you call them - Variants with examples in different langaugaes.

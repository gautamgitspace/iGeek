To create a new ShortLink, we'll send a POST request there. Our POST request will include one required argument: the destination where
our ShortLink will point. It'll also optionally take a slug argument. If no slug is provided, we'll generate one. The response will
contain the newly-created ShortLink, including its slug and destination.

$ curl --data '{"destination": "interviewcake.com"}' https://ca.ke/api/v1/shortlink
{
"slug": "ae8uFt",
"destination": "interviewcake.com"
}

PSEUDOCODE:

def shortlink(request):
    if request.method is not 'POST':
        return Error501

    destination = request.data.destination

    # if they included a slug, use that
    if request.data.slug:
        slug = request.data.slug

    # else, make them one
    else:
        slug = generate_new_random_slug()

    DB.insert('Links', {'slug': slug, 'destination': destination})

    response_body = {
        'slug' : slug,
        }

    return Success200(json.format(response_body))

The code for redirection endpoint:

    def redirect(request):
        destination = DB.get('Links', 'destination', {'slug': request.path})
        return Redirect302(destination)

how generate_new_random_slug() works? 26+26+10 = 62. 62^7 ~ 5 trillion

def generate_random_slug():
  alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
  num_chars = 7
  return ''.join([random.choice(alphabet) for char in num_chars])

But how do we ensure slugs are unique? Two general strategies:

1. "Re-roll" when we hit an already-used slug
2. Adjust our slug generation strategy to only ever give us un-claimed slugs.
2nd one is condierably better. How to do it? Using base conversion - base 62
One potential issue: the current_random_slug_id could give us something that
a user has already claimed as a user-generated slug. We'll need to check for that,
and if it happens we'll just increment the current_random_slug_id and try again
(and again, potentially, until we hit a "random" slug that hasn't been used yet).

def generate_random_slug():
  global current_id
  while True:
      slug = base_conversion(current_id, base_62_alphabet)
      current_id += 1

      # make sure that slug isn't already used
      existing = db.get(slug)
      if not existing:
          return slug

NEXT?
Following a shortlink should be fast.
The shortlink follower should be resilient to load spikes.

The database read to get the destination for the given slug is
certainly going to be our first bottleneck. In general, database
operations usually bottleneck before business logic. What kind
of DB should we use?

NoSQL. Since we won't have any relational queries RDB is of no use.

How else can we speed up database reads?
We could put as much of the data in memory as possible, to avoid disc seeks.

This becomes especially important when we start getting a heavy load of requests to a single link,
like if one of our links is on the front page of Reddit. If we have the redirect URL right there in memory,
we can process those redirects quickly.

Depending on the database we use, it might already have an in-memory cache system.
To get more links in memory, we may be able to configure our database to use more space for its cache.
